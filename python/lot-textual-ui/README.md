# lot-textual-ui

A [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/) TUI front-end for LoT (Lists of
Things). This is a Python sub-project of the LoT monorepo, managed with
[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

Requires Python 3.12+.

## Setup

Install dependencies (creates a virtualenv and resolves from `uv.lock`):

```sh
uv sync
```

## Running

Start the app via the `lot-pui` console script:

```sh
uv run lot-pui
```

(The executable is named `lot-pui` to avoid clashing with the Rust `lot-tui`
binary. A future `lot pui` Rust command will exec `lot-pui`.)

## Development

```sh
uv run ruff check        # lint
uv run ruff format       # format
uv run ruff format --check
uv run pytest            # tests
```

These are also run by the repo-wide `scripts/check` gate when `uv` is
available.
